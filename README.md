# 👾 Azur — Cursed Dev, Still Functional™

> _“I spend most of my time optimizing things that would take less time to be left unoptimized.”_

## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m Azur — fullstack web developer, part-time bug exorcist, full-time CSS survivor.  
I also train soon-to-be devs to suffer professionally.

I code, I teach, and I question my life choices every time Docker says “it works on my machine” and then... doesn’t.

## 🔧 My (Un)Holy Stack

- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS (raw, because frameworks are for the weak), TypeScript, React Native, Next.js, Figma  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Swagger, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **Miscellaneous:** Vite, bun, and an ongoing love-hate relationship with Docker

💀 *I dislike PHP with passion, avoid CSS frameworks like the plague, and believe every site deserves more soul than Bootstrap gray.*

## 🧑‍🏫 Developer Trainer IRL

I train two kinds of people:
- **Web integrators** who fight their first battles against `float`, `position: absolute`, and their own patience.
- **Full-stack devs** who get hit with Symfony, Docker, UML diagrams, automated tests, and despair.

I use GitHub as an educational tool to create briefs, tasks, and commit messages that say more about life than any philosopher could.

## 🧪 Side Projects

- [Does My Mouse Work](https://Azur-tsx.github.io/DMMW/) — a completely serious tool to check if your mouse is alive. You're welcome.
- [DevHub](https://github.com/Azur-tsx/DevHub) — A resource hub I created to help my students survive the web dev jungle. If it saves them one StackOverflow visit, it’s already a win.
- [README Factory](https://github.com/Azur-tsx/readme-factory) — Because everyone deserves a half-decent GitHub profile, even if they don't know what `markdown` is. Answer a few questions, get a readme, pretend your repo is alive.
- **Mileage tracker app for caregivers** — Backend worked great… until the frontend started modifying the wrong row. I’m fine, thanks for asking.

## 💬 Dev Quotes I Actually Use

> "We’re not here to piss code."  
> "Cheating isn’t bad — getting caught is."  
> "No worries, VS Code is probably the one at fault. Again."  
> "Of course I’ll check your code again. Maybe this time the bug fixed itself out of pity."  
> "Sure, let me drop everything to confirm that yes, the file you’re importing doesn’t exist."  
> "Of course I can come take a look for the 36th time, just to help you realize you misspelled `styles.css` again."

## 🚧 Work in Progress

I’m polishing my old projects to build a proper portfolio.  
It takes time when you spend 3 hours refactoring a `div` just to center it.
